* [Fontawesome 5.15.2](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [Simple Lightbox 2.70](https://simplelightbox.com/)

## Installation

**Minimal-Blank** is a Hugo theme. So, before installing the theme, you need to 

* Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), 
* and create a new site ([procedure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-2-create-a-new-site)).

Then **Minimal-Blank** can be deployed as many other themes, with 3 possible ways:

1. Git clone
2. Git submodule
3. Download ZIP and manual install

### Option 1: Git clone

From the root directory of your site, 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/egeorjon/minimal-blank themes/minimal-blank
```
This method could generate some issues with some hosting platforms (like Netlify).

### Option 2: Git submodule

From the root directory of your site,
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/egeorjon/minimal-blank themes/minimal-blank
```
Edit the file `config.toml`, and update the first line
```toml
theme = "minimal-blank"
```
This is the method officially supported by Netlify.

### Option 3: Download ZIP and manual install

[Download the ZIP file](https://github.com/egeorjon/Minimal-Blank/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), and unpack it into the folder `themes/minimal-blank`.
Edit the file `config.toml`, and update the first line
```toml
theme = "minimal-blank"
```

## Usage

If you have some content, just start Hugo built-in server to see your site!

```bash
hugo server -D
```

if not, you can get the content from `examplesite`
```bash
cd my-site
cp themes/Minimal-Blank/examplesite content
hugo server
```

Then enter, use the following url [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in your favorite browser.

## Configuration

### Tests and production

By default, the theme runs in test mode.
For moving to the production mode, you have to set the environment variable `HUGO_ENV`
```bash
export HUGO_ENV=production
```

if you are not using bash (and/or if you are in a Microsoft Windows environment
```cmd
SET HUGO_ENV=production
```

In the Production environment,

* Google Analytics is enabled,
* RSS links are enabled,
* ROBOTS directive are set to INDEX, FOLLOW.

### Language

Available translations are in the `/i18n` directory of the theme. Today only frenh, and english are available.
You can configure the language modifying the following key, in the site configuration file (usually `config.toml`).

```toml
DefaultContentLanguage = "fr"
languageCode           = "fr-fr"
```

### Date format

By default, the date format is `dd-mmm-yyyy` everywhere. You can configure this format, by using the following in the configuration file:
```toml
[params]
formatdate = "<date format>"
```

Example:
```toml
[params]
formatdate = "Jan 2, 2006"
```
will display June 5, 2020.

The full documentation for the date formats is [HERE](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants "Package time"), or [HERE](https://golang.org/src/time/format.go?h=date "Source file src/time/format.go")

### Site title / brand

The navigation bar includes the main menu, and the title of the site/blog (the brand). You can fully customize the brand. In the configuration file of the site:

```toml
[params]
brandlogo   = "<the path of the image related to the /static folder>"
brandtitle  = "<the title of the site>"
displaybrandtitle = true or false
```

Examples:

1. Example 1: Display both logo, and the title

```toml
[params]
brandlogo = "img/logo.png"   # The file must be put in the folder /static/img.
brandtitle = "John Doe"
displaybrandtitle = true
```

2. Example 2: Display only the logo (and put the title in the `alt` attribute of the logo)

```toml
[params]
brandlogo = "img/logo.png"
brandtitle = "John Doe"
displaybrandtitle = false
```

3. Example 3: Display only the title

```toml
[params]
brandlogo = ""
brandtitle = "John Doe"
displaybrandtitle = true
```
will give the following result


### Navigation

You have two ways for configuring the navigation menu (in the top bar).
You can start by
```toml
sectionPagesMenu = "main"
```
The menu will list the sections, and the pages in `/content`.

You can also customize the menu
```toml
[menu]

[[menu.main]]
identifier = "id of the item 1"
name = "Item 1"
url = "/<url of the item 1>"
weight = 10

[[menu.main]]
identifier = "id of the item 2"
name = "Item 2"
pre  = "html code to be addedd before the name"
url = "/<url of the item 2>"
weight = 20

...
```
The `weight` field define the order of the item in the list (smaller weights are displayed first).

Example:
```toml
[[menu.main]] 
  identifier = "photo"
  name       = "Photography"
  pre        = "<i class="fas fa-camera"></i>
  url        = "/photo/"
  weight     = 20
```

### Pagination

You can define the number of posts listed in each page of the lists. In the configuration file `config.toml`

```toml
paginate = <the number of posts>
```

### The lists

The lists are used to display a set of posts, in a section, for a serie, a tag, or an author.
For such pages, the parameters are the following

* `postcolumns`: an array for specifying the number of columns, according the width of the screen
  * sm for small, 
  * md for medium, 
  * lg for large, 
  * and xl for eXtra large
* `displayimage`: display the image associated to each post,
* `meta`: list of meta field to be displayed, with the display order. The available fields are
  * section,
  * date,
  * reading (the estimation duration of read),
  * tags,
  * authors,
  * category.

Example: 

```toml
[params.list]
  postcolumns   = { "sm" = 1, "md" = 1, "lg" = 2, "xl" = 2 }
  displayimage  = false
  meta = { 1 = "section", 2 = "date", 3 = "reading", 4 = "tags" }
#    meta = { 1 = "section", 2 = "date", 3 = "reading", 4 = "tags", 5 = "authors", 6 = "category" }
```

### The posts

The pages where the posts are displayed, are split into to parts

* The post itself,
* The "bottom"

For the post part, the parameters are more or less, the same than for the lists.

* `bottomcolumns`: number of columns according the screen's width,
* `metatop`: list of the meta fields to be displayed before the post,
* `metabottom`: list of the meta fields to be displayed after the post.

```toml
[params.Single]
  bottomcolumns = { "sm" = 1, "md" = 1, "lg" = 2, "xl" = 2, "xxl" = 3 }
  metatop       = { 1 = "date",    2 = "reading" }
  metabottom    = { 1 = "section", 2 = "tags"    }
```

You can also configure what is displayed at the bottom of the post. You can selected "widgets".

Example: 
```toml
[params.Single.Widgets]
  related     = { type = "series-or-related", weight = 3 }
  share       = { type = "share-links",       weight = 2 }
  author      = { type = "authors",           weight = 1 }
``` 

The `weight` allow to display the widgets is a specific order.
The possible widgets listed in the chapter [Footer](#Footer)

### Footer

The top part of the footer contains widgets. You can select the widgets you want to display. The syntax is the following:

```toml
[params.FooterWidgets]
  columns    = { <number of columns according the screen's width> }
  [params.FooterWidgets.Widgets]
    [params.FooterWidgets.Widgets.<widget id>]
      type   = "<type of the widget>"
      weight = <order>
```

Example:
```toml
[params.FooterWidgets]
  columns    = { "sm" = 1, "md" = 2, "lg" = 2, "xl" = 3 }
  [params.FooterWidgets.Widgets]
    [params.FooterWidgets.Widgets.series]
      type   = "series"
      weight = 1
    [params.FooterWidgets.Widgets.about-links]
      type   = "text"
      weight = 2
      params = "links"
    [params.FooterWidgets.Widgets.followme]
      type   = "follow"
      weight = 3
```

The possible widgets are

    notAlternative  = true

[outputs]
  home    = ["HTML", "RSS", "JSON", "MANIFEST"]
```

### Styles

So far, the theme doen't provide an easy way to customize styles.
However, you can customize the theme with two ways

* All default `Bootstrap` values used by the theme are in the file `themes/Minimal-Blank/assets/customization.scss`.
* The theme styles are in the file `themes/Minimal-Blank/assets/styles.scss`

The theme uses the icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). You can add icons if required, by editing the file `themes/Minimal-Blank/assets/fontawesome-free-5.15.2-web/scss/_icons.scss`, and uncomment the line corresponding to the icon you want to display.
