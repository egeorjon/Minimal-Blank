## Configuration

### Tests and production

By default, the theme runs in test mode.
For moving to the production mode, you have to set the environment variable `HUGO_ENV`
```bash
export HUGO_ENV=production
```

if you are not using bash (and/or if you are in a Microsoft Windows environment
```cmd
SET HUGO_ENV=production
```

In the Production environment,

* Google Analytics is enabled,
* RSS links are enabled,
* ROBOTS directive are set to INDEX, FOLLOW.

### Language

Available translations are in the `/i18n` directory of the theme. Today only frenh, and english are available.

You can configure the language modifying the following key, in the site configuration file (usually `config.toml`).

```toml
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
```

### Date format

By default, the date format is `dd-mmm-yyyy` everywhere. You can configure this format, by using the following in the configuration file:
```toml
[params]
formatdate = "<date format>"
```

Example:
```toml
[params]
formatdate = "Jan 2, 2006"
```
will display June 5, 2020.

The full documentation for the date formats is [HERE](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants "Package time"), or [HERE](https://golang.org/src/time/format.go?h=date "Source file src/time/format.go")

### Site title / brand

The navigation bar includes the main menu, and the title of the site/blog (the brand). You can fully customize the brand. In the configuration file of the site:

```toml
[params.navbar]
brandlogo = "<the path of the image related to the /static folder>"
brandlogo-small = "<the path of the image related to the /static folder>"
brandtitle = "<the title of the site, empty if you want only the logo>"
DisplayBrandTitle = true
```

Examples:

1. Example 1: Display both logo, and the title

```toml
[params.navbar]
brandlogo = "img/logo.png"
brandlogo-small = "img/logo-sm.png"
brandtitle = "John Doe"
DisplayBrandTitle = true
```
will give the following result

2. Example 2: Display only the logo (and put the title in the `alt` attribute of the logo)

```toml
[params.navbar]
brandlogo = "img/logo.png"
brandlogo-small = "img/logo-sm.png"
brandtitle = "John Doe"
DisplayBrandTitle = false
```
will give the following result

3. Example 3: display only the title

```toml
[params.navbar]
brandlogo = ""
brandlogo-small = ""
brandtitle = "John Doe"
DisplayBrandTitle = true
```
will give the following result


### Navigation

You have two ways for configuring the navigation menu (in the top bar).
You can start by
```toml
sectionPagesMenu = "main"
```
The menu will list the sections, and the pages in `/content`.

You can also customize the menu
```toml
[menu]

[[menu.main]]
identifier = "id of the item 1"
name = "Item 1"
url = "/<url of the item 1>"
weight = 10

[[menu.main]]
identifier = "id of the item 2"
name = "Item 2"
url = "/<url of the item 2>"
weight = 20

# ...
```
The `weight` field define the order of the item in the list (smaller weights are displayed first).

### Pagination

You can define the number of posts listed in each page of the lists. In the configuration file `config.toml`

```toml
paginate = <the number of posts>
```

### Footer (top)

The top part of the footer contains widgets. You can select the widgets you want to display. In the configuration file `config.toml`, 

```toml
[params.footer.widgets]
tagcloud     = true
categorylist = true
series       = true
about        = true
about-page   = "/about.md"
```

Of course, if you want, you can develop you own widget, and put it in the folder `themes\minimal-blank\layout\partial\widgets`.

### Footer (bottom)

The bottom part of the footer is composed of a `copyright` area, and `social links` area.
The `copyright`part can be configured with the following parameters

```toml
[params.copyright]
firstdate = "<first year of publication>"
CopyrightString = "<the copy right string>"
attribution = "<the owner of the site>"
```
Example:
```toml
[params.copyright]
firstdate = "2008"
CopyrightString = "Copyright &copy;"
attribution = "John Doe"
```
will display the following
`2008-2020 Copyright &copy; - John Doe`

The social links can be configured also
```toml
[params.followlinks]
twitter = "<link to your Twitter account"
github = "<link to your GitHub account>"
facebook = "<link to your facebook account>"
pinterest = "<link to your PInterest account>"
linkedin = "<link to your LinkedIn account>"
rss = "<link to your RSS file>"
```
Example:
```toml
[params.followlinks]
twitter = "https://twitter.com/johndoe"
github = "https://github.com/johndoe"
facebook = ""
pinterest = ""
linkedin = "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
rss = ""
```
will display the following

### Google Analytics

You can optionally enable Google Analytics. Type your tracking code in the `config.toml` file.

```toml
googleAnalytics = "UA-XXXXX-X"
```

### Styles

So far, the thme doen't provide an easy way to customize styles. However, the theme uses `Bootstrap`. All values used by the theme are in the file `/assets/scss/var_custo.scss`.

* You can update the values in this file,
* and the stylesheet will be automatically updated during the next build.
